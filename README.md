Quick start 🚀
-----------
Prerequisites 🧰
-------------
```bash
- Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended)
- npm (comes with Node) or any compatible package manager
```
Features ✨
--------
- 🔐 Login: the app uses dummy credentials for authentication (use the credentials provided in the app or the `fakeAccount.js` file). A successful login grants access to the cards page.
- 🃏 Cards list: the main authenticated view shows a list of cards (fetched data displayed as cards).
- 🔎 Card details: open a specific card to see more details about that item (detail view or modal).
Additional features ➕
-------------------
- 👁️‍🗨️ Login screen: password show/hide toggle to help users verify their input.
- 🔍 Search: search characters by word — type a keyword to filter characters/cards (uses SWAPI's search endpoint to return matching results).
- ⎋ Logout: a clear logout action to end the session and return to the login screen.
- 🎨 Styling: the cards page includes improved styling for readability and accessibility.
- 🙂 User-friendly flow: straightforward navigation and helpful UI states (loading, empty, error).
- ✅ Authenticated user check: routes and views check authentication state and redirect to login when necessary.
APIs used 🔗
---------
```bash
- Characters: https://swapi.dev/ — the Star Wars API (used to fetch character data displayed in the app) 🪐
- Images: https://picsum.photos/ — placeholder image service (used to provide images for cards and avatars) 🖼️
Add a test user ➕👤
---------------
Example user entry (add this as a new line inside the array):
```javascript
{ username: "user", password: "pass123", name: "John Doe" },
```
- ⚠️ For production apps, do not store credentials in plain files — this is for demo/testing only.
